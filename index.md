I am a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/index.php). I work with [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net/) and [Ellen Broswlow](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/ellen.broselow/). I am interested in phonology and phonetics in tonal languages:

- tone-intonation interactions
- phonological representations
- computational nature of tones
