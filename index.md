I am a PhD student (started 2021) in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/index.php). I work with [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net/) and [Ellen Broswlow](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/ellen.broselow/). I am interested in phonology and phonetics in tonal languages:
- tone-intonation interactions
- phonological representations
- computational nature of tones

Before Stony Brook, I got my master degree from Nanhang University (Nanjing, China) in 2021. My master thesis investigated the phonetic cues of rhetorical questions in Mandarin. Additionally, I have conducted field studies in the Northwest of China, engaging with diverse dialects/languages such as Uyghur in Xinjiang (my birthplace and hometown) and Lanzhou in Gansu China. Some other languages that I was fancsicatend include Wu dialects (Southeastern China) and Hausa (west Africa).
