<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/index.php). I work with [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net/) and [Ellen Broselow](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/ellen.broselow/). My research interest is primary in tone languages. Specifically, these questions include:

- phonological representation
- interaction between tone and intonation/segments/metrical structure
- computational nature of tone and its processe

Before Stony Brook, I got my master degree from Nanhang University (Nanjing, China) in 2021. My master thesis investigated the phonetic cues of rhetorical questions in Mandarin. Additionally, I have conducted field studies in the Northwest of China, engaging with diverse dialects/languages such as Uyghur in Xinjiang, China (my birthplace and hometown) and Lanzhou in Gansu, China. Some other languages that I was fancsicatend include Wu dialects (Southeastern China) and Hausa (west Africa).

My Chinese name is ÊùéÊôó (l«ê h√°n) where *l«ê* is my family name meaning "plum" and *h√°n* my given name, meaning "dawn".
