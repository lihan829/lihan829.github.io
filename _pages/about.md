# Hi there!

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/index.php). I work with [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net/) and [Ellen Broselow](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/ellen.broselow/). My research interest is primary in tone languages. Specifically, these questions include:

- tonal representation and autosegmental theory
- interaction between tone and intonation/segments
- production and perception of tones
- computational model of tonotactics and tonal processes

Before Stony Brook, I got my master degree from Nanhang University (Nanjing, China) in 2021. My master thesis investigated the phonetic cues of rhetorical questions in Mandarin. Additionally, I have conducted field studies in the Northwest of China, engaging with diverse dialects/languages such as Uyghur in Xinjiang, China and Lanzhou in Gansu China. Some other languages that I was interested in include Wu dialects (Southeastern China), Cantonese, Hokkein, Hausa (west Africa)

My Chinese name is ÊùéÊôó (l«ê h√°n) where *l«ê* is my family name meaning "plum" and *h√°n* is my given name meaning "dawn". I was born and raised in [Turpan, Xinjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turpan). The word "Turpan" means "the lowest place" in Uygur and "the fertile land" in Turki. I grew up in a community where Mandarin, Uyghur, Kazakh, Sichuan, Shanghainese were all spoken.
